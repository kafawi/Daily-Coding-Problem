The ``solution`` module
======================

Using ``calc_products_of_all_others``
-------------------
  >>> from solution import calc_products_of_all_others as f

Test cases from the example:

  >>> f([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
  [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]

  >>> f([3, 2, 1])
  [2, 3, 6]

Test cases from the eample in the concept

  >>> f([2, 3, 4, 5])
  [60, 40, 30, 24]

Not trivial Test cases (edge cases):
 input is an empty array -> empty array back
  >>> f([])
  []

 input has just one entry -> array with 1 as only entry
  >>> f([142])
  [1]

 input is null/None
  >>> f(None)
  Traceback (most recent call last):
     ...
  TypeError: 'None' is not allowed for input
