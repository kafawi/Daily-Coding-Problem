# Daily Coding Problem

This is my attempt to solve the Daily Coding Problems (DCP) - a daily brain snack provided by https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/ via newsletter. The problems are interview questions from real job interviews. The DCPs pile up in my mailbox for too long. Let's tackle it!

Just some nodes:
- The language is choose by mood. 
  - sometimes there will be more 
- It is inspired by a similar Repro: https://github.com/vineetjohn/daily-coding-problem 
- each problem should have a design concept
- For the curiosity: I do this, to test my ADHD medication and strategies.
